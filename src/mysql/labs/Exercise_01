 * MySQL Exercise 1:
 *
 *      Using MySQLWorkbench,
 *
 *      1.) If you haven't already, create the college database as instructed here:
 *              https://platform.codingnomads.co/learn/mod/page/view.php?id=2133
 *      2.) Create a new table "students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *
 *      3.) Create a new table "teachers_students" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. student_id
 *          c. teacher_id
 *
 *      4.) Create a new table "teachers" with the following fields:
 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. last_name
 *          d. subject
 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table.
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various
 *          teachers with various students.
 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks:
 *          a. select all students
                select * from students;
 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included)
                select * from teachers where subject ="Math";
 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher
                select * from students
                join teachers_students ON student_id = teachers_students.student_id
                join teachers ON teacher_id = teachers_students.teacher_id
                where teachers.first_name = "Debbie";
 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject
                select * from students
                join students_courses ON course_id = students_courses.student_id
                join courses on courses.id = students_courses.course_id
                where courses.name ="Math101";
 *          e. update a record in the student table
                    UPDATE students SET email = "updated@gmail.com" where students.id = "1";
 *          f. add a record to the teacher table
 *              INSERT INTO teachers
                (first_name, last_name, subject)
                VALUES
                ("Stanley","Walker", "Marketing");
 *       8.) Export the schema to a dump file and copy it to this folder.
